Known Issues
============

General
#######

    * Java used memory size

        Ajust the memory usage by Java according to your needs. When using
        memory intensive tasks as mzIdentML conversion of large files, an
        adjustement of the Java Xmx values may be required. The default is the
        usage of 13 GB of your RAM. Please refer to the Java documentation
        for further information.
        http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html
        In Ursgal the parameter `java_-Xmx` can be used to adjust the Java memory
        usage.
        
    * MS-GF+ (or another Java based engine) crashes
    
        Please make sure that you have installed the current Java Runtime Environment
        Download (Java SE Development Kit 8u131):

Windows general
###############

    * Some modules can not be compiled/installed with python3.4+ using pip. 
        
        E.g. pyahocorasick can not be installed. This has the consequence, that on Windows
        the old peptide mapper version is used. There are several workarounds to compile and
        install the modules manually, e.g.:

Windows 10
##########

    * MS Amanda can not load .fasta files
    * calculating the md5 can cause problems e.g. while executing test. 
         This is due to different line endings on Unix and Windows systems. The test functions test for both md5, 
         so this problem should be avoided.


MONO
####

    * Mono is the .NET replacement under *nix systems, since .NET is not directly
        ported by Microsoft to other systems than windows.
        Unfortunately mono is not as stable as the official .NET build. Therefore:

        |    MS Amanda crashes randomly under *nix systems (e.g. Linux or OS X)
